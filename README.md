- 👋 Hi, I’m @DouglasAKies
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Fullstack Engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Soon I will be learning some back-end development through Node.JS and React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that can enhance my portfolio and keep me moving along the path to a new industry. I hope to do so with individuals who are happy to help introduce someone to the SWE/Tech World and can help me along the way.
